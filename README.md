# STPA-DSL

The respository contains the VS Code Extension of the STPA-DSL. 

## Developing the VS Code extension

The following steps are required to start developing:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/).
2. Run ```yarn``` in the root folder to install all dependencies.
3. Run the "Run STPA Extension" launch configuration.
4. A VS Code instance with the STPA-DSL extension should be started.

For development on a Linux system the "copy-language-server" and "copy-webview" script in the package.json in the extension folder must be adjusted.
